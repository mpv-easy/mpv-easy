## install mpv

You can download and install mpv player from the official website https://mpv.io/installation/

If you are a Windows user, you can download the [mpy-easy-windows-full](https://github.com/mpv-easy/mpv-easy/releases/latest/download/mpy-easy-windows-full.zip) directly

## install script

Download the latest release script for your platform(eg: mpy-easy-windows.zip) and extract all to the mpv scripts directory, for example:

```txt
portable_config
├── fonts
│   └── JetBrainsMonoNerdFontMono-Regular.ttf
├── scripts
│   ├── mpv-easy.js
└── shaders
    ├── *.glsl
```


## install protocol

When you start mpv for the first time, it will register the mpv-easy protocol and it will need to modify the registry. A confirmation window may pop up. Please select Yes.

### cookie

Install the chrome extension [get-cookiestxt-locally](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc) and copy the cookie string to portable_config/cookies.txt

If you want to use cookies from multiple websites, you can directly splice it after this file. Note that you need to delete the first two lines.
For example:

```
# Netscape HTTP Cookie File

Then install script [mpv-easy-play-with.user.js](https://github.com/mpv-easy/mpv-easy/releases/latest/download/mpv-easy-play-with.user.js)

When play-with detects videos in the page, you can add all videos to the mpv player through the mpv icon in the lower left corner
