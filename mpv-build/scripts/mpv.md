# Shaders

- [Anime4K](https://github.com/bloc97/Anime4K) - A series of shaders designed to scale and enhance anime. Includes shaders for line sharpening, artefact removal, denoising, upscaling, and more.
- [LumaSharpenHook](https://gist.github.com/voltmtr/8b4404b4e23129b226b9e64863d3e28b) - A sharpen filter similar to using Unsharp Mask in Photoshop ported from SweetFX shader pack.
- [SSimDownscaler, SSimSuperRes, Krig, Adaptive Sharpen, etc.](https://gist.github.com/igv) - * SSimDownscaler: Perceptually based downscaler. SSimSuperRes: The aim of this shader is to make corrections to the image upscaled by mpv built-in scaler (removes ringing artifacts, restores original sharpness, etc). Krig: Chroma scaler that uses luma information for high quality upscaling.
- [Noise](https://github.com/haasn/gentoo-conf/blob/xor/home/nand/.mpv/shaders/noise.glsl) - Simplistic filter that adds a tunable amount of uniform white noise to the output.
- [Film Grain v1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haasn/gentoo-conf/xor/home/nand/.mpv/shaders/filmgrain.glsl)** and **[Film Grain v2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haasn/gentoo-conf/xor/home/nand/.mpv/shaders/filmgrain-smooth.glsl) - Two configurable shaders for applying gaussian-weighted white noise to the image. v2 is a smoothed version of v1, which uses an extra gaussian blur pass to shift the grain frequency spectrum. Both versions can trivially be adapted to add film grain to other channels besides `LUMA` by just adding it to the list of hooks.
- [Antiringing](https://github.com/haasn/gentoo-conf/blob/xor/home/nand/.mpv/shaders/antiring.hook) - This is an antiringing filter that works by clamping to the local neighbourhood. Sort of inspired by the mpv built-in antiringing algorithm, but it's extended in such a way that it also works well for polar (EWA) filters, which the mpv built-in algorithm does not support at all.
- [nnedi3 and ravu](https://github.com/bjin/mpv-prescalers/tree/master) - User shaders for prescaling.
- [acme-0.5x](https://gist.github.com/bjin/15f307e7a1bdb55842bbb663ee1950ed) - Fastest 0.5x downscaler for mpv, useful for 4K video playback on FHD screen (bypass chroma upscaling and color conversion in 4K resolution).

- [hyperview](https://gist.github.com/bjin/399cb23818ad210941725ef768893499) - Dynamic stretching filter aiming to bring effects similar to GoPro SuperView.
- [FSRCNN](https://github.com/igv/FSRCNN-TensorFlow/releases) - Prescaler based on layered convolutional networks.
- [un360](https://gist.github.com/tesu/196db5421559de3e9555d4f9da9d847d) - Converts equirectangular 360 degree video to be watchable, at a fixed perspective.
- [Nonlinear stretch](https://gist.github.com/sarahzrf/c9909aee70e3656895820f20ac395956) - Non-linear stretch scaling. use with `--no-keepaspect`.
- [FidelityFX CAS](https://gist.github.com/agyild/bbb4e58298b2f86aa24da3032a0d2ee6) - AMD FidelityFX Contrast Adaptive Sharpening (CAS) provides a mixed ability to sharpen and optionally scale an image. The algorithm adjusts the amount of sharpening per pixel to target an even level of sharpness across the image. Areas of the input image that are already sharp are sharpened less, while areas that lack detail are sharpened more. This allows for higher overall natural visual sharpness with fewer artifacts.
- [FidelityFX FSR](https://gist.github.com/agyild/82219c545228d70c5604f865ce0b0ce5) - AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution is a spatial upscaler: it works by taking the current anti-aliased frame and upscaling it to display resolution without relying on other data such as frame history or motion vectors. At the heart of FSR is a cutting-edge algorithm that detects and recreates high-resolution edges from the source image. Those high-resolution edges are a critical element required for turning the current frame into a “super resolution” image. FSR provides consistent upscaling quality regardless of whether the frame is in movement, which can provide quality advantages compared to other types of upscalers.
- [NVIDIA Image Scaling](https://gist.github.com/agyild/7e8951915b2bf24526a9343d951db214) - NVIDIA Image Scaling is a spatial scaling and sharpening algorithm. The scaling algorithm uses a 6-tap scaling filter combined with 4 directional scaling and adaptive sharpening filters, which creates nice smooth images and sharp edges. In addition, an adaptive-directional sharpening-only algorithm is available. The directional scaling and sharpening algorithm is named NVScaler while the adaptive-directional-sharpening-only algorithm is named NVSharpen.
- [Post upscale unsharp masking](https://github.com/garamond13/unsharp_masking.glsl) - This is mpvs original image sharpening algorithm ported into the shader, in order to work only after upscaling is done.
- [nlmeans, hdeband, & more](https://github.com/AN3223/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/mpv/shaders/) - nlmeans is a featureful implementation of the Non-local Means algorithm, it does both denoising and adaptive sharpening. hdeband is an implementation of a debanding algorithm that blurs homogeneous regions together.
- [Alt Scale](https://github.com/garamond13/alt-scale) - An alternative to mpv's built in scaling. It can be slightly faster than built in scaling with equivalent quality.
- [Unsharp mask and Gaussian blur](https://github.com/garamond13/Unsharp-mask-and-Gaussian-blur) - A 2 pass unsharp mask and a 2 pass gaussian blur. Similar to those in Photoshop, Image Magick, Gimp, etc.

- [Pixel Clipper](https://github.com/Artoriuz/glsl-pixel-clipper) - Simple anti-ringing filter based on pixel clipping/clamping.
- [JointBilateral & FastBilateral](https://github.com/Artoriuz/glsl-joint-bilateral) - Chroma upsamplers that use the luma plane as a guide to achieve sharper transitions without introducing any ringing.
- [A-Pack](https://github.com/butterw/bShaders/tree/master/A-pack) - Shaders pack for quick Adjustment of (web) video: brightness/contrast curves (tooDark, tooBright, bShadows, bDim, etc.) and color (vibrance, skintones, Black&White). Runs on integrated graphics.
