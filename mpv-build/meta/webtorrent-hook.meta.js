// @description  Allows streaming torrents using webtorrent (same as mpv-peerflix-hook but using webtorrent instead). Webtorrent-cli can play in mpv with `webtorrent --mpv`, but this script allows using torrent identifiers as the file argument to mpv or pasting them into the current playlist using one of the pasting scripts listed here. It also supports additional functionality like automatic file cleanup and the ability to remember the last file played in the torrent. See the readme for more information. See [here](https://github.com/noctuid/mpv-webtorrent-hook#comparison-with-webtorrent-mpv-hook) for a comparison with the other javascript webtorrent plugin. I recommend this plugin over my others (mpv-peerflix-hook and btfs-stream).
